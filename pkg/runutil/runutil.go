// Package runutil provides helpers to advanced function scheduling control like repeat or retry.
//
// It's very often the case when you need to excutes some code every fixed intervals or have it retried automatically.
// To make it reliably with proper timeout, you need to carefully arrange some boilerplate for this.
// Below function does it for you.
//
// For repeat executes, use Repeat:
//
//	err := runutil.Repeat(10*time.Second, stopc, func() error {
//		// ...
//	})
package runutil

import (
	"time"
)

// Repeat executes f every interval seconds until stopc is closed.
// It executes f once right after being called.
func Repeat(interval time.Duration, stopc <-chan struct{}, f func() error) error {
	tick := time.NewTicker(interval)
	defer tick.Stop()

	for {
		if err := f(); err != nil {
			return err
		}
		select {
		case <-stopc:
			return nil
		case <-tick.C:
		}
	}
}
